# Untitled Reimagined - Vintage Vinyl Marketplace

This project imagines a Vinyl Marketplace, where the user buys the records based off of a spectrogram album cover. This spectrogram is generated by generative AI along with the sound of that spectrogram with the prompt being the title of the album itself. 

This idea originated from the Brooklyn flea market, a typology of market in which the merchandise cannot be photographed. We ask: Is there a way to represent the unseen sound of the Vinyl while maintaining the privacy of the vendors?

The generated image and sound/spectrogram or "image that sounds" is a spectrogram that actually looks like the prompt. In this case, the image that sounds is the album cover of the vinyl. Therefore, the anonymity of the vendor is kept while a new representation of the album is created and sold. 

The website itself acts as a digital marketplace in which users can browse and buy vinyls based on these sound clips and album covers.
